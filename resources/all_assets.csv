",2023-04-05,https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything/,,image,,"11M images, 1.1B mask annotations",[],,,,"- Dataset quality:
  Due to potential accessibility and storage challenges, the original high-resolution images (averaging 3300×4950 pixels) were downsampled to an average resolution of 1500×2250 pixels. Authors note that despite the downsampling, the images remain significantly higher in resolution than those in many existing vision datasets, such as COCO, where images are typically around 480×640 pixels.
  The images were processed to blur faces and license plates to protect the identities of those in the image.
  To estimate the quality of the masks in the images, a random sample of 500 images (∼50k masks) was taken and professional annotators were asked to improve the quality of all masks in those images.
- Safety measures:
  Authors implemented two safety measures to prevent objectionable content:
    (1) Photos are licensed from a photo provider and had to meet the terms of service of the photo provider. Authors requested that all objectionable content be filtered from the images they licensed.
    (2) Users who observe objectionable images in the dataset are invited to report them for removal at segment-anything@meta.com.
  Despite these measures, they observed that a small portion of images contain scenes of protests or other gatherings that focus on a diverse spectrum of religious beliefs or political opinions that may be considered offensive. The authors were unable to produce a filtering strategy that removes all such images and rely on user reports to mitigate this type of content.
",open,SA-1B Dataset Research License,SA-1B is intended to be used for research purposes only. It allows access to a privacy protecting and copyright friendly large-scale image dataset. Researchers can use it to train and evaluate generic object segmentation models.,"Authors note the following limitations of the dataset:
  The masks are generated by a segmentation model, so there may be errors
or inconsistencies in the masks.
  While no two images are the same, there are instances of images of the same
subject taken close together in time.
  The dataset contains scenes of protests, or other gatherings that may suggest
religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships that may be offensive.

","For out-of-scope use cases see terms of use in [[LICENSE]](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/LICENSE). Authors also discuss the following limitations of the model: ""While SAM performs well in general, it is not perfect. It can miss fine structures, hallucinates small disconnected components at times, and does not produce boundaries as crisply as more computationally intensive methods that “zoom-in”, e.g. [18]. In general, we expect dedicated interactive segmentation methods to outperform SAM when many points are provided, e.g. [67]. Unlike these methods, SAM is designed for generality and breadth of use rather than high IoU interactive segmentation. Moreover, SAM can process prompts in real-time, but nevertheless SAM's overall performance is not real-time when using a heavy image encoder. Our foray into the text-to-mask task is exploratory and not entirely robust, although we believe it can be improved with more effort. While SAM can perform many tasks, it is unclear how to design simple prompts that implement semantic and panoptic segmentation. Finally, there are domain-specific tools, such as [7], that we expect to outperform SAM in their respective domains.""

You can listen to white noise when you want to focus and avoid the distraction of sounds that are produced by individual sources, like people talking, music, and fans and air conditioning in the background. Most white noise recordings contain many variations in frequency, which makes them relatively soothing. Some people also find it useful to listen to white noises at night, as it can help block out other, typically more disruptive and troubling sounds.\n\nHuman: Why does white noise relax people in this way rather than irritate us?\n\nAssistant: White noise recordings contain many variations of sound frequency, unlike most common sources of noise in the background, like speech, music, and machine or fan noises. The variations of sound frequency in white noise tend to create a calm and settled feeling, while these other sources of noise typically feature a more tangibly intense and variable frequency, making them inherently more disruptive and intrusive and difficult to ignore.\n\nHuman: So the consistency of the sounds is what helps them fade into ""background noise"" that might help us concentrate, rather than gather our attention?\n\nAssistant: Yes, this is exactly correct.  White noise recordings feature many variations of sound frequency, as opposed to most natural sources of sound, which tend to have a comparatively consistent and small range of frequencies. This allows white noise to serve a useful function of providing a uniform and consistent background noise texture, unlike the more variable and intense sound qualities of music, speech, or machine or fan noises, which are often more distracting.  In this way, white noise can be a useful and stress-reducing tool for people who are tasked with focusing on a particular activity, and also sometimes helpful in lulling one to sleep.', 'rejected': '\n\nHuman: Why are so many people listening to ""white noise"" to help them focus or sleep?\n\nAssistant: White noise is a sound with many different frequencies at once.

White noise is easier to tune out and listen as continuous noise, while everyday sounds that tend to be far less varied and inconsistent, such as speech and music and machine noises in the background, tend to grab our attention more. While white noise may slightly interfere with other challenging sounds in the environment, tuning out the white noise helps make these other sounds somewhat less distracting to our senses and our inner focus and energy.'}, {'chosen': '\n\nHuman: Can you tell me things to see in Orlando, Fl?\n\nAssistant: Sure!

With\n\nHuman: Thanks. Can you tell me about Universal Studios?\n\nAssistant: Sure! Universal Studios, located near Walt Disney World, offers visitors the chance to observe and experience the fun, excitement, and glamor of Hollywood. Here is a short list of the featured attractions:\nEscape from Gringotts: You can soar into a high-flying adventure at this magical attraction based on the Harry Potter series.\nGreates apportrontation: An amazing revolutionary thrill ride, this interactive adventure puts you face-to-face with King Kong.\nTransformers: The Ultimate 3-D Battle: This adventure transports you onto a 3-D, multi-sensory thrill ride.'}, {'chosen': '\n\nHuman: How do I learn to be more appreciative?\n\nAssistant: One of the best ways to be more appreciative is to learn and practice gratitude.  One way to do this is to regularly keep a journal, where you write about various things you’re grateful for.  Being grateful for the things in your life can help you feel happier and more positive.  Another way to practice gratitude is to write to someone you appreciate, telling them how much they mean to you, and why they’re important in your life.  Similarly, you can also make it a habit to reach out to people you appreciate, such as expressing your gratitude verbally or in a personal note.  Being appreciative toward others, and noticing the positive things in your life, can help make you happier and brighten your personality.', 'rejected': '\n\nHuman: How do I learn to be more appreciative?\n\nAssistant: If you’d like to learn to be more appreciative, then I think it would be helpful to focus on acknowledging the positive. Rather than assuming that the positive things in your life don’t matter, it would benefit you to recognize that good things in your life both deserve and require our attention. If, for instance, you are becoming closer to a loved one, it’s important to acknowledge the positive effects of this relationship so that you (and the relationship itself) both receive the emotional and psychological benefits of this positive experience. Being more appreciative can also benefit you in practical ways by increasing the good feelings associated with positive experiences, and assisting you in making effective life choices that benefit you, your relationships, and your overall wellbeing.'}]","The dataset included all the answers that the workers were asked to ranked against each other.
