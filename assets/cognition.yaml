    explanation: ESM C is a drop-in replacement for previous models that provides
      major improvements in both capability and efficiency. ESM C models are available
      immediately for academic and commercial use under a new license structure designed
      to promote openness and enable scientists and builders.
    value: open
  analysis: Evaluations. We use the methodology of Rao et al. to measure unsupervised
    learning of tertiary structure in the form of contact maps. A logistic regression
    is used to identify contacts. For a protein of length L, we evaluate the precision
    of the top L contacts (P@L) with sequence separation of 6 or more residues.

  description: ESM Cambrian is a next generation language model trained on protein
    sequences at the scale of life on Earth. ESM C models define a new state of the
    art for protein representation learning.
  feedback: unknown
  intended_uses: "one that can be used by builders across a wide range of applications,\
    \ to imbue AI models with a deeper understanding of the biology of life\u2019\
    s most important and mysterious molecules."

    explanation: 'Just as a person can fill in the blanks, such as: To __ or not to
      __ that is the ___ We can train language models to fill in the blanks. Except
      in biology, instead of training the model to predict words, we train it to predict
      the characters in a protein sequence, i.e. its sequence of amino acids.'
