    explanation: "Just as a person can fill in the blanks, such as: To __ or not to __ that is the ___ We can train language models to fill in the blanks. Except in biology, instead of training the model to predict words, we train it to predict the characters in a protein sequence, i.e. its sequence of amino acids."
    value: text; text
  analysis: "Evaluations. We use the methodology of Rao et al. to measure unsupervised learning of tertiary structure in the form of contact maps. A logistic regression is used to identify contacts. For a protein of length L, we evaluate the precision of the top L contacts (P@L) with sequence separation of 6 or more residues."
  size:
    explanation: "ESM C is trained at three scales: 300M, 600M, and 6B parameters."
    value: 6B parameters

  quality_control: "ESM C was reviewed by a committee of scientific experts who concluded that the benefits of releasing the models greatly outweigh any potential risks."
  access:
    explanation: "ESM C is a drop-in replacement for previous models that provides major improvements in both capability and efficiency. ESM C models are available immediately for academic and commercial use under a new license structure designed to promote openness and enable scientists and builders."
