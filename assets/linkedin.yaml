  description: More than 40 percent of LinkedIn's feed posts include at least one
    image. We want every member to have equal access to opportunity and are committed
    to ensuring that we make images accessible to our members who are blind or who
    have low vision so they can be a part of the online conversation. With Azure Cognitive
    Service for Vision, we can provide auto-captioning to edit and support alt. text
    descriptions.
