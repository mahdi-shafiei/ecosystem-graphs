  name: Chronos
  organization: Amazon
  description: Chronos is a family of pretrained time series forecasting models
    based on language model architectures. A time series is transformed into a sequence
    of tokens via scaling and quantization, and a language model is trained on these
    tokens using the cross-entropy loss. Once trained, probabilistic forecasts are
    obtained by sampling multiple future trajectories given the historical context.

  url: https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting
  model_card: https://huggingface.co/amazon/chronos-t5-large
  modality: time-series; time-series
  analysis: Chronos has been evaluated comprehensively on 42 datasets both in the
    in-domain (15 datasets) and zero-shot settings (27 datasets). Chronos outperforms
    task specific baselines in the in-domain setting and is competitive or better
    than trained models in the zero-shot setting.
  size: 710M parameters (dense)
  dependencies: [T5]
  training_emissions: ''
  training_time: 63 hours on p4d.24xlarge EC2 instance
  training_hardware: 8 NVIDIA A100 40G GPUs
  quality_control: Chronos was evaluated rigorously on 42 datasets, including 27
    in the zero-shot setting against a variety of statistical and deep learning
    baselines.
  access: open
  license: Apache 2.0
  intended_uses: Chronos can be used for zero-shot time series forecasting on univariate
    time series from arbitrary domains and with arbitrary horizons. Chronos models
    can also be fine-tuned for improved performance of specific datasets. Embeddings
    from Chronos encoder may also be useful for other time series analysis tasks
    such as classification, clustering, and anomaly detection.
