  analysis: Chronos has been evaluated comprehensively on 42 datasets both in the
    in-domain (15 datasets) and zero-shot settings (27 datasets). Chronos outperforms
    task specific baselines in the in-domain setting and is competitive or better
    than trained models in the zero-shot setting.

  description: Chronos is a family of pretrained time series forecasting models based
    on language model architectures. A time series is transformed into a sequence
    of tokens via scaling and quantization, and a language model is trained on these
    tokens using the cross-entropy loss. Once trained, probabilistic forecasts are
    obtained by sampling multiple future trajectories given the historical context.
  feedback: https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting/discussions
  intended_uses: Chronos can be used for zero-shot time series forecasting on univariate
    time series from arbitrary domains and with arbitrary horizons. Chronos models
    can also be fine-tuned for improved performance of specific datasets. Embeddings
    from Chronos encoder may also be useful for other time series analysis tasks such
    as classification, clustering, and anomaly detection.
