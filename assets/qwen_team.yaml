  description: Qwen2-Math is a series of specialized math language models built upon
    the Qwen2 large language models, with a focus on enhancing the reasoning and mathematical
    capabilities. Their intended use is for solving complex mathematical problems.
    They significantly outperform both open-source and closed-source models in terms
    of mathematical capabilities.
  feedback: Problems with the model should be reported to the Qwen Team via their
    official channels.
  intended_uses: These models are intended for solving complex mathematical problems.
