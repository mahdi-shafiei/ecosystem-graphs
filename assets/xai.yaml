  analysis: The Grok-2 models were evaluated across a series of academic benchmarks
    that included reasoning, reading comprehension, math, science, and coding. They
    showed significant improvements over the earlier model Grok-1.5 and achieved performance
    levels competitive to other frontier models in areas such as graduate-level science
    knowledge (GPQA), general knowledge (MMLU, MMLU-Pro), and math competition problems
    (MATH).

  description: Grok-2 is a state-of-the-art language model with advanced capabilities
    in both text and vision understanding. It demonstrates significant improvements
    in reasoning with retrieved content and tool use capabilities over its previous
    Grok-1.5 model. It also excels in vision-based tasks and delivers high performance
    in document-based question answering and visual math reasoning (MathVista). Grok-2
    mini, a smaller version of Grok-2, is also introduced, offering a balance between
    speed and answer quality.
  feedback: Issues with the model should be reported to xAI.
  intended_uses: The model is intended to be used for understanding text and vision,
    answering questions, collaborating on writing, solving coding tasks, and enhancing
    search capabilities.
