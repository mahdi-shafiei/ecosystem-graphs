  name: Grok-2
  organization: xAI
  description: Grok-2 is a state-of-the-art language model with advanced capabilities
    in both text and vision understanding. It demonstrates significant improvements
    in reasoning with retrieved content and tool use capabilities over its previous
    Grok-1.5 model. It also excels in vision-based tasks and delivers high performance
    in document-based question answering and visual math reasoning (MathVista).
    Grok-2 mini, a smaller version of Grok-2, is also introduced, offering a balance
    between speed and answer quality.

  model_card: unknown
  modality: text; text, vision
  analysis: The Grok-2 models were evaluated across a series of academic benchmarks
    that included reasoning, reading comprehension, math, science, and coding. They
    showed significant improvements over the earlier model Grok-1.5 and achieved
    performance levels competitive to other frontier models in areas such as graduate-level
    science knowledge (GPQA), general knowledge (MMLU, MMLU-Pro), and math competition
    problems (MATH).
