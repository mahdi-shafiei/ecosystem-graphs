    explanation: See [[Experiments]](https://github.com/kakaobrain/coyo-dataset#experiments)
    value: '"We empirically validated the quality of COYO dataset by re-implementing
      popular models such as ALIGN, unCLIP, and ViT. We trained these models on COYO-700M
      or its subsets from scratch, achieving competitive performance to the reported
      numbers or generated samples in the original papers."

    value: 'Authors note the following limitations: "Kakao Brain tried to construct
      a "Safe" dataset when building the COYO dataset. However, despite these efforts,
      this large-scale dataset was not hand-picked by humans to avoid the risk due
      to its very large size (over 700M). Keep in mind that the unscreened nature
      of the dataset means that the collected images can lead to strongly discomforting
      and disturbing content for humans. The COYO dataset may contain some inappropriate
      data, and any problems resulting from such data are the full responsibility
      of the user who used it."
