  analysis: Extensive testing on Multilingual Librispeech dataset resulted in 20%
    lower validation perplexity. In downstream evaluations, this leads to a 2x lower
    word error rate and a 1 point higher quality score. Sonic also displays impressive
    performance metrics at inference, achieving lower latency (1.5x lower time-to-first-audio),
    faster inference speed (2x lower real-time factor), and higher throughput (4x).
