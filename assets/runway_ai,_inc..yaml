  name: Gen-3 Alpha
  organization: Runway AI, Inc.
  description: Gen-3 Alpha is a foundation model trained for large-scale multimodal
    tasks. It is a major improvement in fidelity, consistency, and motion over the
    previous generation, Gen-2. Gen-3 Alpha can power various tools, such as Text
    to Video, Image to Video, and Text to Image. The model excels at generating
    expressive human characters with a wide range of actions, gestures, and emotions,
    and is capable of interpreting a wide range of styles and cinematic terminology.
    It is also a step towards building General World Models. It has been designed
    for use by research scientists, engineers, and artists, and can be fine-tuned
    for customization according to specific stylistic and narrative requirements.
