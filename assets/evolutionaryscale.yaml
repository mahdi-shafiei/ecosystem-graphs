  analysis: The model was tested in the generation of a new green fluorescent protein.
    Its effectiveness was compared to natural evolutionary processes, and it was deemed
    to simulate over 500 million years of evolution.

  description: ESM3 is the first generative model for biology that simultaneously
    reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. It is trained
    across the natural diversity of Earth, reasoning over billions of proteins from
    diverse environments. It advances the ability to program and create with the code
    of life, simulating evolution, and making biology programmable. ESM3 is generative,
    and scientists can guide the model to create proteins for various applications.
  feedback: Unknown
  intended_uses: To engineer biology from first principles. It functions as a tool
    for scientists to create proteins for various applications, including medicine,
    biology research, and clean energy.
