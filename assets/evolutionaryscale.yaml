- type: model
  name: ESM3
  organization: EvolutionaryScale
  description: ESM3 is the first generative model for biology that simultaneously
    reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. It is trained
    across the natural diversity of Earth, reasoning over billions of proteins from
    diverse environments. It advances the ability to program and create with the
    code of life, simulating evolution, and making biology programmable. ESM3 is
    generative, and scientists can guide the model to create proteins for various
    applications.

  model_card: unknown
  modality: Text; Text (the model takes textual instructions as inputs and generates
    textual descriptions of proteins as outputs)
  analysis: The model was tested in the generation of a new green fluorescent protein.
    Its effectiveness was compared to natural evolutionary processes, and it was
    deemed to simulate over 500 million years of evolution.
  size: 98B parameters (Dense)
  dependencies: [ESM2(base model), largest dataset of proteins]
  training_emissions: Unknown
  training_time: Unknown
  training_hardware: One of the highest throughput GPU clusters in the world.
  quality_control: The creators have put in place a responsible development framework
    to ensure transparency and accountability from the start. ESM3 was tested in
    the generation of a new protein, ensuring its quality and effectiveness.
