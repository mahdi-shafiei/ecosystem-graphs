  analysis:
    explanation: See [[Results and Performance]](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-1/#results-and-performance)
    value: In order to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Conformer-1, we sourced
      60+ hours of human labeled audio data covering popular speech domains such as
      call centers, podcasts, broadcasts, and webinars. We then calculated the Word
      Error Rate (WER) of Conformer-1 against these datasets, and compared the results
      against Whisper and a number of other ASR models. To ground our results against
      popular open source speech recognition benchmarks, we also performed the same
      WER analysis against a number of academic datasets.

  description: Conformer-1 is a state-of-the-art speech recognition model trained
    on 650K hours of audio data that achieves near human-level performance and robustness
    across a variety of data, making up to 43% fewer errors on noisy data than other
    ASR models.
