  name: Fuyu Heavy
  organization: Adept
  description: Fuyu Heavy is a new multimodal model designed specifically for digital
    agents.
  created_date: 2024-01-24
  url: https://www.adept.ai/blog/adept-fuyu-heavy
  model_card: none
  modality: image, text; text
  analysis: Evaluated on the MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, and HumanEval benchmarks. According
    to these benchmarks, Fuyu-Heavy is, as of release, the strongest multimodal
    model trained outside of Google or OpenAI.
