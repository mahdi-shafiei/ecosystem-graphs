  name: Reflection Llama-3.1 70B
  organization: Unknown
  description: Reflection Llama-3.1 70B is an open-source LLM, trained with a new technique called Reflection-Tuning that teaches a LLM to detect mistakes in its reasoning and correct course. The model was trained on synthetic data generated by Glaive.

  modality:
    explanation: "you can sample from Reflection Llama-3.1 70B using the same code, pipelines, etc. as any other Llama model." This implies that the model takes text input and produces text output.
    value: Text; text
  analysis: Unknown
  size:
    explanation: The size is in the model's name: "Reflection Llama-3.1 70B."
    value: 70B parameters
  dependencies: [Glaive, Llama 3.1]
  training_emissions: Unknown
  training_time: Unknown
  training_hardware: Unknown
  quality_control: The model uses a Reflection-Tuning technique which allows it to notice mistakes in its reasoning and correct them.
  access:
    explanation: "Reflection Llama-3.1 70B is an open-source LLM."
    value: open
  license: Unknown
  intended_uses: The model is intended for complex reasoning and reflection tasks. It is designed to separate its internal thoughts and reasoning from its final answer.
  prohibited_uses: Unknown
