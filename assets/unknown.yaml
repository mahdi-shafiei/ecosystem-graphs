  description: A large vision-language model with multi-resolution zoom that enhances
    fine-grained visual understanding and reasoning about image regions. The Dragonfly
    model comes in two variants, the general-domain model ("Llama-3-8b-Dragonfly-v1")
    trained on 5.5 million image-instruction pairs, and the biomedical variant ("Llama-3-8b-Dragonfly-Med-v1")
    fine-tuned on an additional 1.4 million biomedical image-instruction pairs.
    Dragonfly demonstrates promising performance on vision-language benchmarks like
    commonsense visual QA and image captioning.

  model_card: unknown
  modality: Image; text
  analysis: The model was evaluated using five popular vision-language benchmarks
    that require strong commonsense reasoning and detailed image understanding,
    AI2D, ScienceQA, MMMU, MMVet, and POPE. It demonstrated competitive performance
    in these evaluations compared to other vision-language models.
  size: 8B parameters (Unknown if sparse or dense)
  dependencies: [LLaMA]
  training_emissions: Unknown
  training_time: Unknown
  training_hardware: Unknown
  quality_control: The model employs two key strategies (multi-resolution visual
    encoding and zoom-in patch selection) that enable it to efficiently focus on
    fine-grained details in image regions and provide better commonsense reasoning.
    Its performance was evaluated on several benchmark tasks for quality assurance.

  intended_uses: Dragonfly is designed for image-text tasks, including commonsense
    visual question answering and image captioning. It is further focused on tasks
    that require fine-grained understanding of high-resolution image regions, such
    as in medical imaging.
