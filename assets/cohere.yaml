  description: Command R is a scalable generative model targeting RAG and Tool Use
    to enable production-scale AI for enterprise. It is an auto-regressive large language
    model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. After pretraining, supervised
    fine-tuning (SFT) and preference training were applied to align model behavior
    to human preferences for helpfulness and safety. Command R is part of a family
    of open weight releases from Cohere and Cohere For AI. Its larger companion model
    is [Command R+](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus).
