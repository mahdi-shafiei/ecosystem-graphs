  name: Command R
  organization: Cohere
  description: Command R is a scalable generative model targeting RAG and Tool Use
    to enable production-scale AI for enterprise. It is an auto-regressive large
    language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. After pretraining,
    supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference training were applied to align model
    behavior to human preferences for helpfulness and safety. Command R is part
    of a family of open weight releases from Cohere and Cohere For AI. Its larger
    companion model is [Command R+](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus).
