  analysis: Extensive evaluations were done with ablation experiments performed on
    pre-training benchmarks such as lambada, triviaqa, hellaswag, winogrande, webqs,
    arc, and boolq. Direct comparisons were also performed with applications like
    GPT and Llama 2.

  description: Pharia-1-LLM-7B is a model that falls within the Pharia-1-LLM model
    family. It is designed to deliver short, controlled responses that match the performance
    of leading open-source models around 7-8 billion parameters. The model is culturally
    and linguistically tuned for German, French, and Spanish languages. It is trained
    on carefully curated data in line with relevant EU and national regulations. The
    model shows improved token efficiency and is particularly effective in domain-specific
    applications, especially in the automotive and engineering industries. It can
    also be aligned to user preferences, making it appropriate for critical applications
    without the risk of shut-down behaviour.
  feedback: Feedback can be sent to support@aleph-alpha.com.
  intended_uses: The model is intended for use in domain-specific applications, particularly
    in the automotive and engineering industries. It can also be tailored to user
    preferences.
