    explanation: open state-of-the-art video generation model... The weights and architecture
      for Mochi 1 are open
    value: open
  analysis: Mochi 1 sets a new best-in-class standard for open-source video generation.
    It also performs very competitively with the leading closed models... We benchmark
    prompt adherence with an automated metric using a vision language model as a judge
    following the protocol in OpenAI DALL-E 3. We evaluate generated videos using
    Gemini-1.5-Pro-002.
