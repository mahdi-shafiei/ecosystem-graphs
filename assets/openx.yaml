  name: GPT-4o
  organization: OpenAI
  description: GPT-4o is an autoregressive omni model that accepts a combination
    of text, audio, image, and video as input and produces any combination of text,
    audio, and image outputs. It is trained end-to-end across text, vision, and
    audio, focusing on multimodal capabilities.

    explanation: '...accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and
      video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs.'
    value: text, audio, image, video; text, audio, image
  analysis: GPT-4o underwent evaluations that included the Preparedness Framework,
    external red teaming, and third-party assessments to ensure safe and aligned
    deployment. The evaluations focused on identifying and mitigating potential
    risks across its capabilities, especially speech-to-speech functionality.
