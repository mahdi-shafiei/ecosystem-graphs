  feedback: Point of Contact is [Victor Sanh](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigscience/P3)
  included: The Public Pool of Prompts relies on the Hugging Face Dataset library.
    Any public dataset in the Datasets library can be prompted. We select the datasets
    that have at least one subset in English and excluded datasets containing (predominantly)
    non-natural language examples.

  intended_uses: This model is being created in order to enable public research on
    large language models (LLMs). LLMs are intended to be used for language generation
    or as a pretrained base model that can be further fine-tuned for specific tasks.
    Use cases below are not exhaustive.

  prohibited_uses: Using the model in high-stakes settings is out of scope for this
    model (e.g. biomedical/political/legal/finance domains, evaluating or scoring
    individuals). The model is not designed for critical decisions nor uses with any
    material consequences on an individual's livelihood or wellbeing. The model outputs
    content that appears factual but may not be correct. Misuse. Intentionally using
    the model for harm, violating human rights, or other kinds of malicious activities,
    is a misuse of this model (e.g. spam generation, disinformation, disparagement,
    deception, surveillance).
