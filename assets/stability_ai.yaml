  description: Stable Video 4D is our latest AI model for dynamic multi-angle video
    generation. It allows users to upload a single video and receive novel-view videos
    of eight new angles/views. This advancement moves from image-based video generation
    to full 3D dynamic video synthesis. Users can specify camera angles, tailoring
    the output to meet specific creative needs. The model is currently available on
    Hugging Face and can generate 5-frame videos across the 8 views in about 40 seconds.
  feedback: Feedback and reports about the progress should be shared via their social
    channels like Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn or their Discord Community.
  intended_uses: This model can be used for creating dynamic multi-angle videos, with
    applications in game development, video editing, and virtual reality. It allows
    professionals in these fields to visualize objects from multiple angles, enhancing
    the realism and immersion of their products.

  analysis: The model was evaluated on its ability to quickly and accurately transform
    a single image into a detailed 3D asset. This evaluation highlighted the model's
    unprecedented speed and quality, marking it as a valuable tool for rapid prototyping
    in 3D work. Compared to the previous SV3D model, Stable Fast 3D offers significantly
    reduced inference times--0.5 seconds versus 10 minutes--while maintaining high-quality
    output.

  description: Stable Fast 3D is a ground-breaking model in 3D asset generation technology.
    It can transform a single input image into a highly detailed 3D asset in around
    half a second, setting new standards in terms of speed and quality in the realm
    of 3D reconstruction. Users start the process by uploading an image of an object.
    Stable Fast 3D then swiftly generates a complete 3D asset, which includes, UV
    unwrapped mesh, material parameters, albedo colors with reduced illumination bake-in,
    and optional quad or triangle remeshing. This model has various applications,
    notably for game and virtual reality developers, as well as professionals in retail,
    architecture, design, and other graphic-intensive professions.
  feedback: Information on any downstream issues with the model can be reported to
    Stability AI through their support request system.
  intended_uses: The model is intended for use in game development, virtual reality,
    retail, architecture, design and other graphically intense professions. It allows
    for rapid prototyping in 3D work, assisting both enterprises and indie developers.
    It's also used in movie production for creating static assets for games and 3D
    models for e-commerce, as well as fast model creation for AR/VR.
