  name: Stable Video 4D
  organization: Stability AI
  description: Stable Video 4D is our latest AI model for dynamic multi-angle video
    generation. It allows users to upload a single video and receive novel-view
    videos of eight new angles/views. This advancement moves from image-based video
    generation to full 3D dynamic video synthesis. Users can specify camera angles,
    tailoring the output to meet specific creative needs. The model is currently
    available on Hugging Face and can generate 5-frame videos across the 8 views
    in about 40 seconds.

  name: Stable Fast 3D
  organization: Stability AI
  description: Stable Fast 3D is a ground-breaking model in 3D asset generation
    technology. It can transform a single input image into a highly detailed 3D
    asset in around half a second, setting new standards in terms of speed and quality
    in the realm of 3D reconstruction. Users start the process by uploading an image
    of an object. Stable Fast 3D then swiftly generates a complete 3D asset, which
    includes, UV unwrapped mesh, material parameters, albedo colors with reduced
    illumination bake-in, and optional quad or triangle remeshing. This model has
    various applications, notably for game and virtual reality developers, as well
    as professionals in retail, architecture, design, and other graphic-intensive
    professions.
  created_date: 2024-08-01
